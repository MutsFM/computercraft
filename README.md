This is a repository collecting all my code for Minecraft's ComputerCraft.
Below is a short overview of the features, with detailed information in the respective folders.

  * ArchiTech Evalator Inc. (`elevator-inc`)
    * An **elevator system** based on minecarts, with a **touchscreen floor selector**.
    * Additional features include a **request-cart-to-floor** functionality and baked-in **floor plan** functionality.
    * **Standalone floor plans** are also included. Floor plans, whether standalone or baked-in, come in non-interactive (just stating what is on the floor) and interactive (with more detailed information presented when clicking on the floor) varieties. 
    * *Requires RailCraft*
  * ArchiTech Traffic Lights (`trafficlights`)
    * A **traffic light** system for vehicles as well as vehicles and pedestrian.
    * Several **different sequences and icons** can be selected for the vehicle traffic lights and the pedestrian lights.
    * An optional feature to **detect the presence of pedestrians** via redstone (e.g. pressure plates).
    * An optional feature to indicate the status of the pedestrian light to players via an **audible signal**.
  * ArchiTech MetroSys (`metro-sys`)
    * To add
  * ArchiTech Building (`ArchiTechBuilding`)
    * A collection of specialised files to demonstrate the ArchiTech programmes in the showrooms of the ArchiTech Building on the ArchiTech server. Not intended for use outside of showrooms.
