Several files in this repository need to be titled differently on your computer in Minecraft in order to work. These files have been titled differently from their intended Minecraft file title in order to be quickly able to identify which file suits your use case.

Each section below will indicate which files need to be titled differently on your computer in Minecraft, and will provide the correct title for use in Minecraft.

For example, the 'startup-ps' needs to be titled as followed on your computer in Minecraft: 'startup'
